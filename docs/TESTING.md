# Testing

tvty is a GUI in front of live agent sessions. Three tools let us test it
without touching the desktop and without spending model tokens.

| Tool | What it is | What it tests here |
|---|---|---|
| [wbox](../../wbox-mcp) | runs tvty in its own nested compositor, headless if wanted, and lets an agent click, type and screenshot inside it | the interface: tabs, gallery, slider, the ticket panel |
| `fake-claude` ([aiball](../../aiball/docs/FAKE-CLAUDE.md)) | a scripted (YAML) stand-in for Claude Code's screen: boot, prompt, `esc to interrupt`, streamed output | the whole chain with no tokens: a real claude-loop, in a real tmux session, through the real PTY proxy, shown by tvty — attach, tabs per agent, alerts |
| [simai-cli](../../simai-cli) | replays an agent CLI session with Claude's chrome from a script, and records it (`.cast`) | rendering and speed: dense, fast output replayed identically to measure smoothness; demo recordings |

## wbox

To register it for this repo (not done yet):

```bash
wboxr init --name tvty --compositor labwc --headless --app-command "target/debug/tvty" --register
```

Its MCP tools reach a Claude session started **in this directory**.

## What the first slice measures

- keystroke → echo latency, and smoothness while an agent streams output;
- the same on GNOME and KDE (Wayland and X11), and on Windows (psmux).
